        <h1><strong>Legal Issues:</strong></h1>
        <h2>Data Protection Act</h2>
        <h3>The 1998 data protection act sought to bring control as to who can access your data and whether that person needs to store your data and what data they are allow to store. It also controlled as to who can see your data and the way information is passed on, first or third parties.</h3> <b></b>
        <h3>The data protection act brought 3 key roles to enforce this law. It brought the information commissioner who has the powers to enforce the data protection act. It brought the data controller who is a person at the company where they are storing and collection the data. It also brought the data subject who is someone who has their information stored on a database somewhere. </h3>
        <h3>When a company wants to store any information a person has to register the information they want to store to their information commissioner. In each entry it has the data controllers name and address, a description of the information stored, what they are going to use the information for, whether the information is going to be passed on to other people, whether the information will go outside of the UK and details of how the data controller will keep the information safe.</h3> <br>
        
        <h1>Computer Misuse Act</h1>
        <h3>The 1990 Computer Misuse Act was to make certain activities on the internet illegal. This included making hacking, piracy, harrasment, indecent pornography, spreading viruses and identity and financial abuse. Hacking was obviously made illegal.Hacking is a term of an unauthorized person gaining access to information or data they are not allowed to see. Piracy was made illegal and is on par with the copyright law. This stopped anyone spreading copyrighten material online however websites like PirateBay are still thriving. Harrasment spreaded to the online world and prevented abuse to someone using online chats like messenger or skype. Indecent pornography like child pornography was made illegal to spread, share and download. It was also made that spreading viruses was made illegal for obvious reasons of damage to the owners property. Identity and financial abuses such as using stolen credit cards to purchase items and scamming, a well known scam is the tech support scam where the person makes it seem that there is a virus and they have to pay for the removal of said virus. </h3>
          
        <h1><strong>Ethical Issues</strong></h1>
        <h1>Code of practices when using email</h1>
        <h3>Common etiquette is required when emailing someone, especially when it is work related. A no-brainer one would be spell checking. Spell checking is important because it comes across as you have barely put any effort into making this email, it is also common knowledge that bad english may typically be a scam, so when contacting a new customer they may think it is a scam and wont reply back. Another etiquette is using all capitals. An example of this is HELLO. When using all caps it is thought that you are shouting, which is rather rude and unprofessional when it is work related. Another etiquette is no use of slang or swear words. This is for obvious reason that it is unprofessional and rude.</h3>
        <h1>Internet Whistle-blower</h1>
        <h3>A whistle blower is someone who spreads secret information about someone, this could be something like a government cover-up or a company doing dodgy deals. A famous whistleblower is Edward Snowden who released many pages about NSA surveillance in June 2013. He has been charged with espionage crimes but is currently in russia in asylum.As a whole, Lawfully, it is wrong, but some people think that what Edward Snowden did was right as everyone deserves the right to know the NSA's dodgy practices in surveillance.</h3>
        
        <h1><Strong>Operational Issues</Strong></h1>
        <h1>Impact of increasing sophisticated systems</h1>
        <h3>Increasing sophisticated systems means that you have to employ new people that have to be skilled to work with them, or train others. This can be a costly process but in the long run it will be vital. When you increase sophisticated systems it also means that maintenance will need to be carried out which would mean that you might have to make a new department or increase staff in that department.</h3>
        <h1>Security of information</h1>
        <h3>Security of information is important, under the data protection act you should not be storing data that you cannot keep safe. Different security measures like malware tools, firewall and other security programs can be implemented to reduce the risk of people gaining access to this information. If you do not secure your data you could be sued under the data protection act so it is best to keep your security technologies updated and always stay secured.</h3>
